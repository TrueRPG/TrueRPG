If you're looking for a decent RPG game, I'm ready to congratulate you, because it's here!<br>
This is a fork of the RPG game that was originally developed by [Screamlark](https://www.twitch.tv/screamlark).
The founder abandon this project, so the community decided to continue development on their own.
We'll get the job done, no matter what!

Don't stand aside, help the project! Pull requests are very welcome!<br>
You can discuss the project [here](https://github.com/TrueRPG/TrueRPG/discussions).
